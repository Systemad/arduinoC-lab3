# arduinoC-lab3

Each assignment is in their own branch

assignment1: Detect if a button is being held, if so print to uart and then if its released, print to uart. 

assigment2: Use PWM along with timer2 and ADC to control LED brightness with the help of a potentiometer.
(yes, its a typo, the assignment2 (no typo) has older code. I will delete it later and fix names

NOTE: Potentiometer is soldered onto a shield, and the LED is connected externally to Port 6, in order to use OCR0A for PWM.
